**Open-Sesame - Password Generator**:

Allows the user to have a random password provided with preferences of at least one of (4) parameters including: length between 8-128 characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.

**Instructions**:

Click on the "generate password" button. A window will pop-up and prompt the user to insert the length of the prepferred password. Then, there will be a succession of parameters offered to create the password (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters). If the user clicks the "ok" button on the selection, the parameter will be utilized in the creation of the password. If the user clicks the "cancel" button on the selection, the parameter will NOT be utilized in the creation of the password. Once each parameter has had an "ok" or "cancel" clicked, the page will display the newly generated password.
